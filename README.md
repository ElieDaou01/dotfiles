## Dotfiles

### MacOS
dotfiles used and tested mostly on MacOS using iTerm2, which will need to 
be manually downloaded from the [website](https://www.iterm2.com/).  
It should all theoretically work pretty well with any \*nix

#### Zsh
Using [Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) for plugins and themes

#### Vim
Using [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim#quick-start) to manage
plugins


#### tmux
Using [Oh-My-tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux) theme with minor 
modification regarding pane splitting added to the end of .tmux.conf.local.

## Install
Run `setup.sh` will install shell and vim environments with corresponding 
config files
